## 2025-12-10 - Council Efficiency Improvements
- **Topic**: Is the current implementation for the council maximizing its efficiency? What is critically missing?
- **Decision**: Implement P0-P4 priority stack: Context Aggregation, Session Persistence, Chair Protocol, Protocol Hardening, Output Standardization, Termination Logic, Failure Recovery, Automated Memory Updates
- **Rationale**: Current implementation had "memory amnesia" (files not being read), no session continuity, and no structured output for automation
- **Dissent**: None - full consensus reached in Round 5
- **Session**: Initial council self-evaluation
